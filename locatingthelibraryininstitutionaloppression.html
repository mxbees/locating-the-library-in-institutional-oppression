Introduction</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" name="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt2" name="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup></h2><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Attempting to understand where the library is located within institutional oppression is a difficult proposition. First, because institutional oppression actively works to disguise, erase, and obfuscate its mechanisms and their consequences; it is very much the proverbial devil -- whose greatest trick is to convince the world that it does not exist. Second, because people sincerely and truly love libraries. They love libraries for a variety of reasons but many tend to associate libraries with a cluster of values that is difficult to gainsay without appearing to side with some fairly unsavoury and undesirable values.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Neil Gaiman recently wrote this about libraries:</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5 c7"><span class="c1">Libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of communication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes the day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe spaces, and about access to information.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt1" name="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c5 c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">How do you begin an excursion to locate the library within institutionalized oppression when this represents the popular, common conception of libraries? Even if we understand this as idealistic and unrealistic, a less idealised understanding of libraries still frames them as fundamentally</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;good</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;institutions that </span><span>occasionally</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;fail to live up to their values or ideals.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">How do we reconcile this understanding of libraries with the very real fact that we continue to live in a deeply inequitable society? A society where oppression fundamentally structures all of our political, social, and economic institutions? Exploring the topology and geography of institutional oppression is a perilous activity and </span><span>fraught</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with many dangers.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">This excursion shall begin setting out the domain of </span><span>discourse</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;-- essentially getting the lay of the land by setting out how key terms like &#39;institutional oppression&#39; or &#39;enlightenment&#39; will be used within the confines of this article. N</span><span class="c1">ext, I w</span><span class="c1">ill delve into the history of libraries to hopefully uncover what libraries were intended to be. This will involve understanding and engaging the notion that libraries are institutions that have been shaped and created as a means to embody and enforce a particular ideology. Last, I will follow one line of inquiry about how libraries embody and articulate one specific kind of institutional oppression, white supremacy, as a way to demonstrate that libraries cannot be distinguished either from their historical roots nor from their contemporary context within a </span><span class="c1">white supremacist settler state.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" name="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt4" name="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c9 c5"><span>2. The Domain of Discourse</span></h2><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span></span></p><h3 class="c9 c5"><span>2.1 Institutional oppression</span></h3><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Perhaps one of the more critical elements of this discussion </span><span class="c1">which requires </span><span class="c1">absolute clarity is the boundaries of what is meant by &#39;institutional oppression&#39;. The notion of institutional or systemic oppression speaks to the ways that certain behaviours, attitudes, and ideologies become formalized in various social, political, and economic organizations, groups, structures, etc. It is about how abstract ideas become reified and concrete through a long, but</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">constantly shifting </span><span class="c1">process of human social organization.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Institutional oppression isn&#39;t about how behaviours, attitudes, and philosophies are embodied in individuals, but individuals most certainly do come to embody these things and act as agents of their institutions while, at the same time, other individuals are oppressed. Nonetheless, this isn&#39;t an examination of the moral and ethical implications of being oppressive as an individual or of being oppressed as an individual. The focus will remain on all the ways that institutions are structured, created, and maintained, thereby reducing the ability of individuals to make decisions to resist these values.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">The </span><span>clearest</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" name="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt6" name="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt7" name="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span class="c1">example within libraries of institutional oppression is controlled vocabularies like the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) or the Dewey Decimal Classifications (DDC). There are several well known examples of bias within these classifications, like the fact that non-Christian religions within the DDC are forced to share a narrow number range because the classification system wasn&#39;t created with the notion of including them. This means that catalogers, whatever their individual beliefs and values,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;must</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;continue to enforce this ideological (and white-centric) belief that non-Christian religions are not important (or as important as the Christian ones).</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">The way the DDC is set up, a single cataloger ethically opposed to the exclusion and marginalization of non-Christian religions within the DDC can do very little to change the overall system. They cannot assign some other number within the DDC and have it be valid or coherent. If they were to use some other system of classification, the resulting records wouldn&#39;t work with current technologies, rendering the items inaccessible. Within such a system, making an ethical choice is very difficult on an individual basis. However, focusing on the system or institution allows us to explore solutions that would allow individuals to make better decisions.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Institutional oppression is about the system and processes that we use in our daily lives that, by the very nature of how they&#39;ve been constructed and devised, exclude, marginalize, and oppress some people to the benefit of others. As such, attempting to locate the library in institutionalized oppression is about identifying the processes and systems within libraries that instantiate oppressive values and beliefs. These beliefs are not necessarily restricted to the library and, as a consequence, libraries must also be analyzed in relation to other social, political, historical</span><span>, </span><span class="c1">an</span><span class="c1">d</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;economic institutions that act upon the library and that the library, in turn, impacts.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c5 c9"><span>2.2 The Enlightenment</span></h3><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Perhaps the current, definitive work on the relationship between libr</span><span class="c1">aries and the enlightenment is</span><span class="c1">, </span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" name="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt9" name="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt10" name="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt11" name="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup><span class="c1">well,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt12" name="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt13" name="cmnt_ref13">[m]</a></sup><span class="c6">Libraries and the Enlightenment</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;by Wayne Bivens-Tatum. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt14" name="cmnt_ref14">[n]</a></sup><span class="c1">Chapter 1 of the book is dedicated to discussing what the enlightenment actually is and lays out the parameters for Bivens-Tatum&#39;s discussion.

I don&#39;t use the word &#39;evil&#39; lightly, but I&#39;m hard pressed to think of any other word to describe a set of philosophical and political ideas that directly led to the deaths of millions of people and the subjugation of pretty much the entire world under white colonial powers</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt4" name="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">M</span><span class="c1">y general perspective is to understand the enlightenment as an ideology. We cannot separate the philosophical and political ideas of the enlightenment from its historical context. Moreover, we cannot separate how these ideas formed the conceptual basis for many of our current political, economic, and social systems.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">This also puts one of Bivens-Tatum&#39;s comments into an interesting light &quot;Attitudes have now changed for many in the West -- in those countries most touched and transformed by </span><span>Enlightenment</span><span class="c1">&quot;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt5" name="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c1">. This statement is almost </span><span>comically</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;ridiculous and so entirely </span><span>Eurocentric</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that it is breathtaking. The first thing we can understand from this statement is that Bivens-Tatum mostly certainly understands the &#39;West&#39; as being the most civilized place in the world as enlightenment thought is understood by many people to have a &#39;civilizing&#39; influence. The fact that he non-critically uses the &#39;West&#39; to demarcate white people from the rest of the world betrays how</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;little he knows (or cares) </span><sup><a href="#cmnt15" name="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt16" name="cmnt_ref16">[p]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt17" name="cmnt_ref17">[q]</a></sup><span class="c1">about the historical context of the enlightenment and of racial politics today. This fairly common usage entirely depends on erasing the inherent violence of the term &#39;Western&#39; when one really means &#39;white&#39;.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt6" name="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;That he is most certainly using &#39;enlightenment&#39; as a stand in for &#39;civilized&#39; is fairly clear when he talks about being &#39;touched and transformed.&#39; We exist in a contemporary reality where entire continents have been laid waste by enlightenment values being forced onto them. Entire cultures and peoples have been so thoroughly transformed after being &#39;touched&#39; by the enlightenment that they no longer even have a history, religion, or culture that would be recognized by their ancestors.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">In any case, my hope in this discussion of the enlightenment and its thought and values is to make it clear that the relative worth of the enlightenment and its </span><span>historical impact</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is heavily influenced </span><span class="c1">by an individual&#39;s own context. Regardless of what Bivens-Tatum asserts, there is no coherent way to separate out the historical/material realities of the enlightenment from its thought and values.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">To further clarify, since Bivens-Tatum engages in an interesting, rhetorical sleight of hand: &quot;If anything, it is the immanent critique within Enlightenment political thought that allows us to view the contrast between the the rhetoric and </span><span>practice</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of, say, Thomas Jefferson, as a contradiction&quot;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt7" name="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c1">. This appears tantamount to Bivens-Tatum asserting that it is</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;because</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of the enlightenment that we are able to criticize the enlightenment. Essentially, that it is an enlightened value of &#39;freedom&#39; that allows us to perceive the contradiction of a slave-owner writing about freedom.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Strangely, this insistence on the complete hegemony of enlightenment values and thought in society today essentially proves the point I&#39;ve been trying to make about the enlightenment as being one of many tools developed during the height of colonialism as a means for ensuring and maintaining white dominance over the world. That Bivens-Tatum fails to make room or space for criticisms of the enlightenment that occur from</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;outside</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of the tradition represents his commitment to the myth-making hegemony of the enlightenment itself</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt8" name="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c1">. This is evident in his statement that &quot;Their historical blindness to their own contradictions hardly negates the universal appeal of enlightened political thought&quot;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt9" name="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Part of the point I&#39;m making is that enlightenment values and political ideas do</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;not</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;have universal appeal. And</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;framing it this </span><span class="c1">way is, itself, a colonial act meant to enforce the current hegemony of the ideology. The reality is, colonialism has been resisted from the beginning and it continues to be resisted. Bivens-Tatum&#39;s responses to critics of the enlightenment has no space for anti-colonial/</span><span>decolonization</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;critiques of enlightenment thought and values.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt18" name="cmnt_ref18">[r]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">This is, above all, where my current criticism of libraries is coming from: understanding them as an institution within a white supremacist settler state and, to the extent to which libraries embody enlightenment values, this is also a </span><span>criticism</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of those values themselves. The ongoing existence of the settler state (especially if we are talking about Canada and/or the US) and all of its institutions necessitates continued </span><span>resistance</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and working towards decolonization.

L</span><span class="c1">ibraries obviously existed before the enlightenment and pre-enlightenment it is pretty easy to see how libraries functioned as a way to entrench social disparities in power: few people were literate, few people had access to libraries, and education was definitely</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;not</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;something that your average person had access to.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>The idea of libraries was created during this period.

Getting </span><span>into</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the history of libraries can take many different paths, but for this paper we are going to follow along with the historical and intellectual context described by Bivens-Tatum in chapter three of</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Libraries and the Enlightenment</span><span class="c1">. The chapter is rather delightfully titled &quot;Public Libraries and the Political Enlightenment&quot;, something that rather supports my ideological approach for </span><span>understanding</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the enlightenment.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">In discussing the purpose of public libraries, he notes that:</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5 c7"><span class="c1">Public libraries began as instruments of enlightenment, hoping to spread knowledge and culture broadly to the people, who as free citizens of a democratic republic required access to that knowledge and culture to live fuller lives and to become better citizens.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt12" name="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c5 c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">He also notes that public libraries pretty have much failed miserably on this account by not being widely used -- and that those who did use it were largely interested in entertainment</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt13" name="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">The first (and most obvious) conclusion we can draw from this is that public libraries in America were and always have been political. They have been, since their inception, creations of a specific and particular ideology. I&#39;m also perfectly willing to follow Bivens-Tatum in saying that this ideology is that of the political enlightenment.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">As such, it is pretty clear that Bivens-Tatum&#39;s idea that historical details and context have little bearing on the ideas can&#39;t hold much weight when we are, at least, speaking of public libraries. The fact that, for this discussion, we are talking about a specific country (the US), at a specific point in time are non-trivial details when attempting to understand the political impact of libraries and the impact politics had in shaping libraries as we know them. Indeed, this shaping by political forces is exactly what Bivens-Tatum discusses in the last section of the chapter</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt14" name="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">And, in anticipation of his arguments against &#39;revisionist histories&#39; about the founding of public libraries</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt15" name="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c1">, I note that I am, in fact, following his account of the historical motivations and ideology surrounding the formation of libraries. I do honestly think that they were motivated by enlightenment ideals. Where we significantly depart is in statements like this, &quot;we can have a reasonable pluralism in society, but only if everyone acknowledges the authority of the public democratic institutions&#39;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt16" name="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">So that my position is very clear: I</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;don&#39;t</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;acknowledge the authority of public democratic institutions. This is exactly</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;why</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I&#39;m writing a paper locating the library in institutional oppression. I&#39;m not attempting to quibble about what is or isn&#39;t the enlightenment or what did or did not motivate the creation of public libraries.

Of course, citizenship in the US has been extended to many kinds of people today. However, the point I&#39;m making about this relationship between libraries and citizenship is exactly that: &#39;citizen&#39; is a flexible political category and who is or isn&#39;t a citizen depends entirely on the American settler state.

From this angle, public libraries were never intended to be universal, rather they were always going to include some information and exclude others.

Since it is a fact that the Indigenous peoples of North America continue to exist, the ideal of libraries as liberal institutions existing to make democracy &#39;better,&#39; thus stronger, is no less than an ideal wherein the genocide of Indigenous peoples is finally completed (putting democracy in its strongest possible position).</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">By and large, this is what is missing from Bivens-Tatum&#39;s glowing account of libraries and the enlightenment.

Except his basic error is not realizing that the historical and material context of the enlightenment is not actually &#39;historical&#39; at all.

In such as situation, it is impossible for neutrality to exist.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Thus, if we look past this claim of neutrality and understand that it is an impossible position, we begin to understand how libraries come to articulate the logic of orientalism. Part of what made Said&#39;s work so groundbreaking and influential is that he demonstrated the way that knowledge creation within the empire is</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;not</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(and never has been) a neutral activity and so the knowledge</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;itself</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cannot be neutral. One of the interesting distinctions often drawn in library literature is between &#39;information&#39; and &#39;knowledge&#39;. Information is understood as neutral facts and knowledge is created when we understand information (or something like that). It is a tidy distinction that allows neutral librarians to feel like we are transmitting neutral facts, all unmediated by reality.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Most criticisms of library neutrality tend to focus on the librarians and/or institution, rather than the &#39;information&#39; or &#39;knowledge&#39; preserved, stored, communicated, and legitimized by libraries. This is something that definitely holds somewhat more true for research collections, like many academic libraries, over public libraries (but public libraries are still very much implicated in this). Said&#39;s claims are, in part, explorations about the epistemology of empire, of colonial expansion, and of war but few criticisms of library neutrality have examined or focused on the role that libraries have within the empire and its epistemology.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">When we look into the collections, the actual &#39;information&#39; contained in libraries and how it is organized, we can see that they (surely by accident) somehow manage to construct a reality wherein whiteness is default, normal, civilized and everything else is Other. In so doing, libraries very much participate in a larger imperial project that justifies war. We see that libraries very happily fulfill this expectation of Bivens-Tatum: &quot;we can have a reasonable pluralism in society, but only if </span><span>everyone</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;acknowledges the authority of the public democratic institutions&quot;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt48" name="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c1">, since these &#39;public democratic institutions&#39; he is discussing are constituent parts of the empire. Seen from this light, is it at all surprising that library collections play their happy role in the Orientalist project of creating the Other?</span></p><h2 class="c9 c5 c12"><span class="c1"></span></h2><h2 class="c9 c5"><span>5 Conclusions</span></h2><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Looking back, now, at this paper and seeing what all I had to say during this excursion, one of the surprising themes (to me at least) is how often the concept of &#39;neutrality&#39; came under fire, even though this was not intended. But, as I consider it now, it seems obvious to me that neutrality has been central to locating the library in institutional oppression. Simply a more complex concept of neutrality than is usually discussed within the literature, which tends to focus on the coherence of the neutrality of the individuals operating and working within libraries or on some of the processes and systems of libraries (like classification).</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">The main notion of neutrality that I challenge within this article is that of institutional neutrality. Regardless of many people&#39;s feelings about the coherence of individual neutrality, many have taken it as axiomatic that libraries are neutral institutions and that any failure of libraries to be neutral is largely the fault of individuals failing to live up to the ideals or ethics of the profession, rather than understanding the library as institution as fundamentally non-neutral. </span><span class="c1">An institution that was created not only for a specific ideological purpose but for an ideology that is fundamentally oppressive in nature.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt40" name="cmnt_ref40">[an]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;As such, the failings of libraries can be re-interpreted not as libraries failing to live up to their ideals and values, but rather as symptoms and evidence of this foundational and oppressive ideology.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">In tying my line of criticism to that of colonialism, settler colonialism, and white supremacy (but as a reminder: there are many other lines of criticism that can and ought to be explored when situating the library in institutional oppression), I also have the seeds of solutions, for those who want for such things. The clear solution is decolonization. Of course, this is a difficult prospect for many within the field since it precludes any solution that is reformist in nature; no reform is possible if we understand libraries as fundamentally white supremacist institutions.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">For those who find this unpalatable, there is, perhaps, a worthwhile solution in decoupling libraries from their avowed goal in </span><span>propping</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;up and strengthening settler democracies. This could allow us to preserve the institution, but would require</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;drastic</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;daring</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;changes to the overall structure and organization of libraries. Libraries, unlike other institutions of settler states (like the judicial system), have at least some emancipatory potential. Again, though, this would require that libraries and librarians be willing to enact drastic changes.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Changes like entirely doing away with the LCSH and DDC. </span><span class="c1">With creating new systems of classification that aren&#39;t fundamentally white supremacist by nature. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt41" name="cmnt_ref41">[ao]</a></sup><span class="c1">It would require breaking and disrupting the system of intellectual property and other aspects of capitalism, especially the publishing industry. It would require disrupting the empire&#39;s mechanisms for creating &#39;knowledge&#39; by not simply being a repository for imperial knowledge products. It would require supporting Indigenous resistance to the settler state.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Of course, all of this means breaking pretty much every established value and ideal of libraries today.</span></p><h2 class="c9 c5 c12"><span class="c1"></span></h2><h2 class="c9 c5"><span>6 Works Cited</span></h2><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Addams, Suellen S., and Kate Pierce. &ldquo;Is There </span><span>a</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Transgender Canon?: Information Seeking and Use in the Transgender Community,&rdquo; 2006. http://www.cais-acsi.ca/proceedings/2006/adams_2006.pdf.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Annoyed Librarian. &ldquo;Libraries as Liberal Institutions.&rdquo; Accessed August 3, 2014. http://annoyedlibrarian.blogspot.ca/2006/12/libraries-as-liberal-institutions.html.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Berman, Sanford, 1933-. &ldquo;&lsquo;Inside&rsquo; Censorship.&rdquo; De Facto Censorship Implicit in Collection Decisions, no. 18 (July 15, 2001): 48&ndash;63.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">Bivens-Tatum, Wayne.
