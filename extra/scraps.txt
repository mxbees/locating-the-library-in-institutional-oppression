One of the clear points of contention is 'citizen.' At the time that the first public library was founded in the US, only white people were citizens (and able to become citizens). Of course, citizenship in the US has been extended to many kinds of people today. However, the point I'm making about this relationship between libraries and citizenship is exactly that: 'citizen' is a flexible political category and who is or isn't a citizen depends entirely on the American settler state. As a consequence, we can see that libraries were never intended to be for 'everyone.'

Of course, not being for everyone isn't necessarily oppressive. We generally understand the purpose and value of some kinds of exclusionary spaces (like women's only shelters or cultural community centres). Even accepting that it is okay for libraries to be exclusionary spaces (which Bivens-Tatum wouldn't find acceptable[^29]), the fact that libraries are structurally inclined to benefit only those people who happened to be citizens when public libraries first became a reality should make us pause. Especially when we see someone like Bivens-Tatum arguing that "this is in fact the ultimate goal of both academic and public libraries, to make all knowledge accessible to every citizen, a universal library accessible to all"[^30].
