###Locating the library in institutional oppression

This is an experimental research project intended to collaboratively create a set of articles/blog posts/etc. exploring the topology of institutional oppression and attempt to discover where the library -- as institution -- resides within this landscape. 

I originally wrote [an outline for the paper](http://goo.gl/Yqxqid) without the intention to write it. However, more than a few people have expressed interest in actually seeing the paper. I also suggested, at the end of the outline, that I might put a CC license on the outline, in case anyone else had an interest in writing the paper. I picked the Apache 2.0 license instead, in part, because I'm more approaching this from an open source perspective, than anything else. Mainly because I want it to be clear that the outline ought to only serve as a starting point for people. The outline expresses what my own feelings and intuitions about where the library is located, but I could be wrong. Or I could be not entirely right. So I encourage anyone interested in pursuing this or engaging in this discussion, to start with the basic idea and modify, change, build on, etc., however they think is best. 

This paper will be published Sept 24, 2014, [In the Library with the Leadpipe](http://inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/). Look for it!

That will also provide the 'canonical' citation for the article.
