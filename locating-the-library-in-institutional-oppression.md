#Locating the Library in Institutional Oppression

##1. Introduction[^64]

Libraries are, in the hearts and minds, of many people a cherished and much beloved institution. There are many of us with fond stories and memories of the worlds of imagination that libraries, via their shelves of books free for the taking, opened up to use. Beyond nurturing young people's love of reading, libraries also embody a certain set of values. As Neil Gaiman recently wrote:

>Libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of communication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes the day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe spaces, and about access to information. [^1]

With libraries holding such a necessary and seemingly unassailable position within our cultural imagination, how do we begin to understand their place within insitutional oppression?

Just as libraries represent notions of freedom, education, and the like, we also exist within a society and culture of great disparity and oppression. In one very simplistic sense, the existence of libraries themselves attest to this reality, since freely available resources wouldn't be necessary if it weren't the case that not everyone has equal access to these resources. Libraries themselves exist to address certain disparities within our society.

This paper is an initial exploration for the ways that libraries, in attempting to address inequity, actually entrench oppression. However, this isn't about the failures of libraries, rather it is about the way that certain values structure libraries such that they come to embody institutional oppression, rather than resist it.

In so doing, I will first discuss how the enligtenment is the ideological underpinings of the library and the historical processes that created the library as we know it today. Next, I analyze the contemporary polical location of libraries within our culture. This is then completed by exploring the implications of the library as institutionalized englightenment ideology using the three logics of white supremacy as proposed by Andrea Smith,[^57] as a way to demonstrate that libraries cannot be distinguished either from their historical roots nor from their contemporary context within a white supremacist settler state.

##2. Whence libraries? 

###2.1 The Enlightenment[^60] as Ideological Foundation for Libraries

In _Libraries and the Enlightenment_ Wayne Bivens-Tatum makes a compelling case for "the scientific and political principles of the Enlightenment provid[ing] the philosophical foundation for American academic and public libraries"[^8]. The _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ describes the enlightenment as "the period in the history of western thought and culture, stretching roughly from the mid-decades of the seventeenth century through the eighteenth century, characterized by dramatic revolutions in science, philosophy, society and politics"[^58]. For the sake of this discussion, we are largely considering the social and political aspects of enlightenment thought.

We focus on the enlightenment and these parts of it because:

>The enduring legacy of the Enlightenment lives on in politics as much as in science, especially in the United States of America, which in some ways is the country best embodying Enlightenment principles.[^59]

He further identifies the key themes of enlightenment political/social/ethical thought as "individual liberty, equal rights, religious toleration, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to education and political participation in a democracy"[^61].

One of the points he is very careful to make in the introduction of the book is that the historical realities of during the period of englightenment do not contradict the values and ideas of the enlightenment. The fact that the founders of the US were slave owners isn't relevant to the ideas and beliefs they espoused and held to, that "their historical blindness to their own contradictions hardly negates the universal appeal of enlightened political thought"[^62].

Insofar as you can buy into this argument, the problem remains that he has little evidence or reason for asserting that enlightened political thought, in actual fact, has universal appeal. Part of the point I'm making, in this exploration of libraries and institutional oppression, is that enlightenment values and political ideas do _not_ have universal appeal. And framing this way is, itself, a colonial act meant to enforce the current hegemony of the ideology. The reality is, colonialism has been resisted from the beginning and it continues to be resisted. Bivens-Tatum's responses to critics of the enlightenment has no space for anti-colonial/decolonialization critiques of enlightenment thought and values. 

This is, above all, where my current criticism of libraries is coming from: understanding them as an institution within a white supremacist settler state and, to the extent to which libraries embody enlightenment values, this is also a criticim of those values themselves. The ongoing existence of the settler state (especially if we are talking about Canada and/or the US) and all of its institutions necessitates continued resistence and working towards decolonization. A small part of which is deconstructing how even cherished and seemingly unassailable institutions like libraries continue the colonial project and, thus, are sites of violence and oppression.

###2.2 The historical genesis of libraries

In discussing the purpose of public libraries, Bivens-Tatum notes that:

>Public libraries began as instruments of enlightenment, hoping to spread knowledge and culture broadly to the people, who as free citizens of a democratic republic required access to that knowledge and culture to live fuller lives and to become better citizens.[^22]

He also notes that public libraries pretty have much failed miserably on this account by not being widely used -- and that those who did use it were largely interested in entertainment[^23].

The first (and most obvious) conclusion we can draw from this is that public libraries in America were and always have been political. They have been, since their inception, creations of a specific and particular ideology. I'm also perfectly willing to follow Bivens-Tatum in saying that this ideology is that of the political enlightenment.

And, in anticipation of his arguments against 'revisionist histories' about the founding of public libraries[^27], I note that I am, in fact, following his account of the historical motivations and ideology surrounding the formation of libraries. I do honestly think that they were motivated by enlightenment ideals. Where we significantly depart is in statements like this, "we can have a reasonable pluralism in society, but only if everyone acknowledges the authority of the public democratic institutions"[^28][^63].

When Bivens-Tatum writes:

>Public libraries began as instruments of enlightenment, hoping to spread knowledge and culture broadly to the people, who as free citizens of a democratic republic required access to that knowledge and culture to live fuller lives and to become better citizens.[^25]

It becomes clear that the primary purpose of libraries wasn't education (as he erroneously concludes from a claim like this[^26]) but was politically. Education within this ideological statement is only a means to an end: creating better citizens. In this instance 'better' equals 'better educated.' Almost nothing in this statement about the purpose of libraries is value-neutral and apolitical. And it would be difficult to unpack everything that is oppressive about this motivation to create libraries. 

In a context like this, many of the current real-world examples about how libraries are 'failing' marginalized people become clearly not a 'failure' but intentional. Public libraries in America and Canada were not designed for everyone; they are, as Bivens-Tatum says, intended for citizens. And their purpose is to create _better_ citizens. This is not a politically neutral purpose. 

If we view libraries as embodying a particular political ideology (that of enlightenment and its support for democracy) and if we understand that libraries were created to make citizens better then libraries are sites of indoctrination. From this angle, public libraries were never intended to be universal, rather they were always going to include some information and exclude others. More importantly, so long as libraries are informed and constrained by the enlightenment ideology, they will never be universal or live up to the dream of containing all knowledge and making it accessible to all peoples.

###3.3 Contemporary Libraries and Liberalism

In my search for resources for this paper, the connection between liberal philosophy and the enlightenment was simply taken as fact rather than something that needed to be established. As such, I'm going to take this as a given: liberalism is the modern day embodiment of enlightenment values.

It does need to be noted, though, that liberalism as political philosophy/ideology is not really at all connected to political parties as they currently exist in Canada or the US. The type of liberal political ideology that was born out of the englightenment fundamentally structures most contemporary political parties and organizations. This ideology broadly enscapsulates the values of having a democratic state, freedom and inherent rights, etc. While current political parties debate about what counts as 'freedom' and how, exactly, the democratic state should be run, most of the larger, influential ones agree on these basic tenets[^33].

In the ALA's Code of Ethics, they write:

>We significantly influence or control the selection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information. In a political system grounded in an informed citizenry, we are members of a profession explicitly committed to intellectual freedom and the freedom of access to information. We have a special obligation to ensure the free flow of information and ideas to present and future generations.[^34]

It should be fairly easy to see the parallels of this statement to what Bivens-Tatum notes was the original motivation for the creation of public libraries, at least as far as the 'political system grounded in an informed citizenry' is concerned. 

As the Annoyed Librarian also notes:

>Outside of a commitment to liberal democracy in general -- which, by the way, is the only regime that supports the intellectual freedom of writers, artists, historians, philosophers, etc. -- liberal institutions should take no substantive political position. A liberal library association would support intellectual freedom, access to information, and liberal democratic political institutions, but wouldn't go on to make political statements irrelevant to libraries.[^35]

While the Annoyed Librarian does think that the ALA (or at least parts of it) are failing this liberal standard, it doesn't make a difference to the reality that, failing or not, liberalism (and thus enlightenment) is the fundamental political philosophy informing how (at the very least) libraries and librarians think of themselves.

Last, as I began exploring in the previous section, we can see that, yes, libraries are political institutions and, from this section, they are politically liberal institutions (in the classical understanding of liberalism). This also means that regardless of what the Annoyed Librarian and ALA wish, the proposition that libraries (and librarians) be politically neutral is a self-defeating one. Claiming that libraries ought to be liberal institutions that take 'no substantive political position' is a political position in and of itself. And it is _not_ a neutral one (if such a thing is even possible). 

##3 Libraries, democracy, and the logics of white supremacy

In locating the library in institutional oppression I'll be focusing on only one line of criticism -- white supremacy and decolonization -- because of how focused my earlier sections are on the role that public libraries play (or ought to play) in maintaining a democratic (settler) state. I'm also largely depending on Andrea Smith's understanding of how white supremacy is constituted: 

>We may wish to rearticulate our understanding of white supremacy by not assuming that it is enacted in a single fashion; rather, white supremacy is constituted by separate and distinct, but still interrelated, logics. I would argue that the three primary logics of white supremacy in the US context include: (1) slaveability/anti-black racism, which anchors capitalism; (2) genocide, which anchors colonialism; and (3) orientalism, which anchors war.[^36]

Her analytic framework provides a three lens way to view how the library, as institution, embodies and enforces one type of oppression, white supremacy. 

Namely, that libraries, being liberal institutions, are not 'neutral' in the ways that many of the sources cited in this paper either want them to be or believe they are.  Rather, the explicit and expressed function of libraries, from their inception in the US and Canadian political structures to their existence today, is to create an informed citizenry for the sake of democracy. This allows us to finally locate the library in institutional oppression. 

###3.1 The Logic of Slavery

Andrea Smith writes:

>One pillar of white supremacy is the logic of slavery. This logic renders black people as inherently enslaveable—as nothing more than property...This logic is the anchor of capitalism. That is, the capitalist system ultimately commodifies all workers: one’s own person becomes a commodity that one must sell in the labour market while the profits of one’s work are taken by somebody else. To keep this capitalist system in place—which ultimately commodifies most people—the logic of slavery applies a racial hierarchy to this system.[^37]

Note one of the key claims in Smith's discussion of the logic of slavery, that it 'anchors capitalism'. Another way of understanding this is that the enslavability of Black people is a necessary and foundational part of capitalism, such that slavery is not the result of capitalism, but rather that capitalism itself is structured around this logic:

>the market did more than surround and detain black bodies — it also possessed them with logics of fungibility and accumulation. Under the logic of the Atlantic slave trade, the market’s arithmetic of accumulation was sutured to the flesh, inhabiting the bodies and lives it stripped down to the sum of their biological parts for sale within the freedom of the market. For the slave, economic rationality possessed every moment of life’s terror and death’s release. Liberal distinctions between the public and private, and the economic, political, and social were fabrications for the slave, illusions that depended on their erasure from the realm of the human. This erasure made possible the alchemy of the market so that with its social, economic, and discursive racial mechanisms, the market could transform a human being into an object and test the limits of that object’s biological life. The fungibility of blackness meant that slaves were money, were animals, were gold, were cotton, were rum, and on and on.[^65]

This fungibility of Blackness also, for Black people, makes notions of intellectual property a fabrication when it comes to Black creative and intellectual work. A reality evidenced by the history of modern/contemporary music whereby every major movement in music over the past 100+ years has happened via a process of the exploitation of Black creative labour with little benefit to their creators. 

However, because the logic of slavery is structures the process of comodification within capitalism we also see that "the overall trend in intellectual property protection is broadly correlated with the rise of capitalism. In fact, some institutional features associated with capitalism had to exist prior to the full development of intellectual property rights"[^56]. While it is possible for intellectual property rights to exist outside of a capitalist framework, the system we current have exists _within_ this framework. This means that our system of intellectual property, having arisen (at least in part) from capitalism, is necessarily structured by the logic of slavery. 

All of this should creates a framework through which we can begin to understand how libraries institutionalize white supremacy. Principle IV in the ALA's Code of Ethics states "we respect intellectual property rights"[^38]. Of course, many people would counter this claim by saying that the manner by which libraries operate fundamentally contradicts this capitalist impulse by making 'intellectual property' freely accessible to the public. Except this isn't entirely true or, rather, it doesn't represent the entire picture. 

When we look at the work of libraries, we begin to see that they actually play a significant role in not just 'respecting intellectual property' but in ensuring the stability of intellectual property itself. One mechanism through which libraries do this is through the creation of 'authority records': "An authority record is a tool used by librarians to establish forms of names (for persons, places, meetings, and organizations), titles, and subjects used on bibliographic records"[^40]. 

While the Library of Congress (LOC) makes it clear that authority records are created with the intent to improve accessibility, the mechanism they use for this ensures that every creative work necessarily has an identifiable owner. This is necessary in a system of capital wherein everything and everyone can (and likely will be) reduced to a commodity.

This is only one way that libraries come to be implicated via active participation in the logic of slavery, of capitalism, and of white supremacy. We can also see that libraries, regardless of their making 'knowledge' or 'information' accessible for free, do not actually challenge or resist this logic. Rather, libraries are another institution necessary for maintaining a system of intellectual property within a larger context of white supremacy that depends on the inherent enslaveability of Black people. 

###3.2 The Logic of Genocide

According to Andrea Smith:

>This logic holds that indigenous peoples must disappear. In fact, they must always be disappearing, in order to enable non-indigenous peoples’ rightful claim to land. Through this logic of genocide, non-Native peoples then become the rightful inheritors of all that was indigenous—land, resources, indigenous spirituality, and culture. Genocide serves as the anchor of colonialism: it is what allows non-Native peoples to feel they can rightfully own indigenous peoples’ land. It is acceptable exclusively to possess land that is the home of indigenous peoples because indigenous peoples have disappeared.[^42]

In earlier sections it was noted that libraries were created and continue to be conceived as institutions designed for benefit of creating an informed citizenry for the sake of democrary. This can only be established as a value in a settler state like the US or Canada if the Indigenous peoples of this region have already disappeared. 

For 'Canada' and the 'United States' to continue to exist as democratic states (or for them to even be conceived as such) requires either that we understand that the Indigenous genocide is already complete or that we ensure that the genocide is ongoing. Since it is a fact that the Indigenous peoples of North America continue to exist, the ideal of libraries as liberal institutions existing to make democracy 'better,' thus stronger, is no less than an ideal wherein the genocide of Indigenous peoples is finally completed (putting democracy in its strongest possible position).

By and large, this is what is missing from Bivens-Tatum's glowing account of libraries and the enlightenment. He wants us to distinguish the historical and material realities of the enlightenment from its ideas/philosophy. Except his basic error is not realizing that the historical and material context of the enlightenment is not actually 'historical' at all. As we continue to grapple with the ideas of the enlightenment today, so do we grapple with the material conditions that both caused and are caused by the enlightenment (settler colonialism, white supremacy, etc).

However, we cannot be surprised by this, since the logic of genocide is "that indigenous peoples must disappear"[^43], so the absence of their struggle against settler colonialism in the US (and all other settler states) is necessary. This absence, of course, extends not only to their physical disappearance, but their disappearance from history and discourse. Thus, the ethical code for librarians is fundamentally rooted in the ongoing Indigenous genocides.

###3.3 The Logic of Orientalism

As Andrea Smith states: 

>The logic of orientalism marks certain peoples or nations as inferior and deems them to be a constant threat to the wellbeing of empire... Consequently, orientalism serves as the anchor of war, because it allows the United States to justify being in a constant state of war to protect itself from its enemies. Orientalism allows the United States to defend the logics of slavery and genocide as these practices enable it to stay “strong enough” to fight these constant wars.[^44]

Smith doesn't go into the details of Orientalism, as it was developed by Edward Said[^50], but libraries firmly belong to the discursive space identified by Said as "a structured set of concepts, assumptions, and discursive practices that were used to produce, interpret, and evaluate knowledge about non-European peoples"[^49]. It is this knowledge that informs the logic of orientalism described by Smith -- the logic that allows the US to justify its ongoing wars.

Libraries disguise their Orientalism by invoking the stance of neutrality: "We distinguish between our personal convictions and professional duties and do not allow our personal beliefs to interfere with fair representation of the aims of our institutions or the provision of access to their information resources"[^45]. However, it is pretty easy to see that libraries are far from neutral spaces. There are many examples in the literature about the ways that collection development[^46], reference[^47], cataloguing[^48], and many other library functions reveal deep biases in how the library as an institution exists. More importantly, as Bivens-Tatum himself writes, "we can have a reasonable pluralism in society, but only if everone acknowledges the authority of the public democratic institutions"[^31]. In such as situation, it is impossible for neutrality to exist.

Thus, if we look past this claim of neutrality and understand that it is an impossible position, we begin to understand how libraries come to articulate the logic of orientalism. Part of what made Said's work so groundbreaking and influential is that he demonstrated the way that knowledge creation within the empire is _not_ (and never has been) a neutral activity and so the knowledge _itself_ cannot be neutral. One of the interesting distinctions often drawn in library literature is between 'information' and 'knowledge'. Information is understood as neutral facts and knowledge is created when we understand information (or something like that). It is a tidy distinction that allows neutral librarians to feel like we are transmitting neutral facts, all unmediated by reality.

Most criticisms of library neutrality tend to focus on the librarians and/or institution, rather than the 'information' or 'knowledge' preserved, stored, communicated, and legitimized by libraries. This is something that definitely holds somewhat more true for research collections, like many academic libraries, over public libraries (but public libraries are still very much implicated in this). Said's claims are, in part, explorations about the epistemology of empire, of colonial expansion, and of war but few criticisms of library neutrality have examined or focused on the role that libraries have within the empire and its epistemology. 

When we look into the collections, the actual 'information' contained in libraries and how it is organized, we can see that they (surely by accident) somehow manage to construct a reality wherein whiteness is default, normal, civilized and everything else is Other. In so doing, libraries very much participate in a larger imperial project that justifies war. We see that libraries very happily fulfill this expectation of Bivens-Tatum: "we can have a reasonable pluralism in society, but only if everone acknowledges the authority of the public democratic institutions"[^31], since these 'public democratic institutions' he is discussing are constituent parts of the empire. Seen from this light, is it at all surprising that library collections play their happy role in the Orientalist project of creating the Other?

##4 Conclusions

Looking back, now, at this paper and seeing what all I had to say during this excursion, one of the surprising themes (to me at least) is how often the concept of 'neutrality' came under fire, even though this was not intended. But, as I consider it now, it seems obvious to me that neutrality has been central to locating the library in institutional oppression. Simply a more complex concept of neutrality than is usually discussed within the literature, which tends to focus on the coherence of the neutrality of the individuals operating and working within libraries or on some of the processes and systems of libraries (like classification).

The main notion of neutrality that I challenge within this article is that of institutional neutrality. Regardless of many people's feelings about the coherence of individual neutrality, many have taken it as axiomatic that libraries are neutral institutions and that any failure of libraries to be neutral is largely the fault of individuals failing to live up to the ideals or ethics of the profession, rather than understanding the library as institution as fundamentally non-neutral. Libraries are an institution that was created not only for a specific ideological purpose but for an ideology that is fundamentally oppressive in nature. As such, the failings of libraries can be re-interpreted not as libraries failing to live up to their ideals and values, but rather as symptoms and evidence of this foundational and oppressive ideology. 

In tying my line of criticism to that of colonialism, settler colonialism, and white supremacy (but as a reminder: there are many other lines of criticism that can and ought to be explored when situating the library in institutional oppression), I also have the seeds of solutions, for those who want for such things. The clear solution is decolonization. Of course, this is a difficult prospect for many within the field since it precludes any solution that is reformist in nature; no reform is possible if we understand libraries as fundamentally white supremacist institutions.

For those who find this unpalatable, there is, perhaps, a worthwhile solution in decoupling libraries from their avowed goal in proping up and strengthening settler democracies. This could allow us to preserve the institution, but would require _drastic_ and _daring_ changes to the overall structure and organization of libraries. Libraries, unlike other institutions of settler states (like the judicial system), have at least some emancipatory potential. Again, though, this would require that libraries and librarians be willing to enact drastic changes. 

Changes like entirely doing away with the LCSH and DDC and creating new systems of classification that aren't fundamentally white supremacist by nature. It would require breaking and disrupting the system of intellectual property and other aspects of capitalism, especially the publishing industry. It would require disrupting the empire's mechanisms for creating 'knowledge' by not simply being a repository for imperial knowledge products. It would require supporting Indigenous resistance to the settler state. 

Of course, all of this means breaking pretty much every established value and ideal of libraries today.

[^19]: While this doesn't really fit into the scope of the paper, I just wanted to point out just how simply the genocide of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas is erased with this quotation, by Matthew Wolfson on the enlightenment, "It was also the period in which North and South America were discovered, depopulated and then repopulated." 'Depopulated' is such a sanitary term for the genocide of _millions_ of people. More to the point, this is on ongoing genocide as settler states like Canada and the US continue the colonial project. This is why using 'western' for 'white' is violent, as it erases the ongoing genocide of the Indigenous people of the Americas. It treats the colonial project of 'depopulating' and 'repopulating' the Americas as finished, when it is pretty clear that Indigenous peoples in Canada and the US continue to resist settler colonialism.

[^39]: Like with above, it is also unsurprising that a system of intellectual property is fundamentally organized by the logic of slavery, since it is also fairly easy to see that the creative works of Black people within this system still achieve the most extreme position within this system. It is ridiculously apparent in today's contemporary cultural millieu that Black creative and intellectual works are considered property in a very different way than the work created by non-Black peoples. Their intellectual property is 'ownable' (thus exploitable) by everyone other than themselves, since 'property' cannot itself own property but the yields of 'property' can be exploited or claimed by the first non-Black person who desires it. The interesting thing about the appropriation of Black culture and creative works is how often people don't realize it.

[^60]: Bivens-Tatum is careful to note his bias towards the enlightenment on page 4 of his book when he writes "I will be discussing the principles of the Englightenment in a positive way." In the same spirit, I'll state outright that I think the enlightenment is and was evil because it is the ideology of colonialism. I don't use the word 'evil' lightly, but I'm hard pressed to think of any other word to describe a set of philosophical and political ideas that directly led to the deaths of millions of people and the subjugation of pretty much the entire world under white colonial powers.

[^63]: So that my position is very clear: I _don't_ acknowledge the authority of public democratic institutions. This is exactly _why_ I'm writing a paper locating the library in institutional oppression. I'm not attempting to quibble about what is or isn't the enlightenment or what did or did not motivate the creation of public libraries. Part of my argument rests on the understanding that libraries, as an institution, are oppressive _because_ of their relationship to a white supremacist, hetero-patriarchal settler state. And because of the exact reasons he describes: libraries are necessary for creating better citizens of a democratic state. This is one of the major reasons why, as they currently exist in Canada and the US, libraries are a tool of oppression, rather than of liberation. 

[^64]: A note about the research/citation methodology of this article: I've decided to make a principled stance about only citing open access resources. The exception within the paper is monographs, which haven't been considered by the OA movement in the same way. But as far as article and other scholarly resources are concerned, if I wasn't able to find a non-paywalled copy, I haven't cited or used it within this paper. There are obviously and unfortunate limitations when strictly adhering to such a principle, since many of the more concrete papers that would have been very useful for supporting a few of my points aren't open access, which does weaken my arguments (but not by much, since the information and research to support many of my claims does, in fact, exist).
